- Issues that have already been submitted by another user or are already known to the Polymath team are not eligible for bounty rewards. (Make sure that the issue has not been previously submitted or fixed in other more recent commits)
- Public disclosure of an actively exploitable vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty.
- Determinations of eligibility, rewards and all terms related to an award are at the sole and final discretion of the Polymath team.


**Responsible Disclosure Guidelines**

We ask that you follow the following responsible disclosure guidelines:

1. Do not exploit a security vulnerability you discover for any reason.
2. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations.
3. Give us a disclosure deadline on any vulnerability you report, consistent with complexity of the fix. Please give us a reasonable amount of time (minimum 2 weeks) to correct the issue before making the exploit public.
4. Give us 3 business days to respond to your report. We will provide our assessment of the severity of the vulnerability and our timeline for patching it based on our internal assessment of when we can have a fix in place.
