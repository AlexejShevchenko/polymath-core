# Contributing Guidelines

## Do you have any questions?

Please check out our Developer Portal (http://developers.polymath.network/) to see if you can find your answer there first. If not, ask us your questions on our Gitter (https://gitter.im/PolymathNetwork/Lobby).

## Report bugs!

Do not open an issue on Github if you think your discovered bug could be a security-relevant vulnerability. Please, read our security policy instead.

Otherwise, just create a new issue in our repository and state:

What's your Polymath version?
What's your operating system and version?
How did you install parity?
Is your node fully synchronized?
Did you try turning it off and on again?
Also, try to include steps to reproduce the issue and expand on the actual versus expected behavior.

## Contribute!

If you would like to contribute to Polymath, please fork it, fix bugs or implement features, and propose a pull request.
